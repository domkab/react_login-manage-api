# react_login-manage-users

This project demonstrates my ability to rapidly develop and deploy fully-functional web applications (developed in less than a week). It's designed to showcase a blend of user-friendly features with efficient backend integration, ideal for anyone interested in evaluating my skills in web app development.

## Description

This repository hosts a dynamic and rapidly developed web application showcasing my proficiency in building full-featured apps with a swift development cycle. Built with React and a JSON server, the application offers a comprehensive suite of features centered around user interaction and task management. Key functionalities include:

- **User Authentication**: An intuitive login system serves as the entry point, ensuring secure access to user profiles.

- **Profile Customization**: Users can personalize their experience by modifying their username and password, adding a personal touch to their profile.

- **Task Management**: A core feature of the application, allowing user to assign task to their profiles, fostering productivity and organization. For now, since there is only one selectable "profile" you can only edit tasks related to admin.

- **Todo Management**: Implements a robust system for managing todos, with capabilities for adding, editing, and deleting tasks as per user requirements, each todo can be assigned to user, creating a data relationship.

- **User Management**: Similar to the Todo functionality, the application allows for comprehensive management of user profiles, enhancing the adminstrative experience, this could be used for administrator to edit add and delete any form of data, users are just used as mock up.

- **Note for future**: This is just a base app, however it has laid a solid ground for this app to grow, with many potential UI/UX improvements possible to be implemented in the future
- If the application further grows and improves TypeScript with Redux is a consideration
## Technologies Used

- **React**: For a responsive and component-driven user interface.
- **JSON Server**: Providing a simple backend to simulate API responses for user and task data.
