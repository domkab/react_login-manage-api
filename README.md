This project demonstrates my ability to rapidly develop and deploy fully-functional web applications (developed in less than a week). It's designed to showcase a blend of user-friendly features with efficient backend integration, ideal for anyone interested in evaluating my skills in web app development.

## Description

This repository hosts a dynamic and rapidly developed web application showcasing my proficiency in building full-featured apps with a swift development cycle. Built with React and a JSON server, the application offers a comprehensive suite of features centered around user interaction and task management. Key functionalities include:

- **User Authentication**: An intuitive login system serves as the entry point, ensuring secure access to user profiles.

- **Profile Customization**: Users can personalize their experience by modifying their username and password, adding a personal touch to their profile.

- **Task Management**: A core feature of the application, allowing users to assign tasks to their profiles, fostering productivity and organization.

- **ToDo Database**: Implements a robust system for managing todos, with capabilities for adding, editing, and deleting tasks as per user requirements.

- **User Management**: Similar to the ToDo functionality, the application allows for comprehensive management of user profiles, enhancing the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For a responsive and component-driven user interface.
- **JSON Server**: Providing a simple backend to simulate API responses for user and task data.
